% Generate the transmitted data: First, generate a sequence of data that you want to transmit over the wireless channel. This can be done using the randi function, which generates random integers between 0 and 1. For example:
data = randi([0 1], 1, 100000);
% This generates a sequence of 100,000 random bits (0s and 1s).

% Modulate the data: Next, modulate the data using a specific modulation scheme. This can be done using the modulate function, which takes the data and the desired modulation scheme as input. For example:
modulated_data = modulate(data, 'QPSK');

% This modulates the data using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK).

% Add noise: Next, add noise to the modulated data to simulate the effects of the wireless channel. This can be done using the awgn function, which adds additive white Gaussian noise to the signal. For example:
noisy_data = awgn(modulated_data, 10);
% This adds noise to the signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.

% Demodulate the data: Next, demodulate the noisy data using the same modulation scheme as was used to modulate the data. This can be done using the demodulate function, which takes the noisy data and the modulation scheme as input. For example:
demodulated_data = demodulate(noisy_data, 'QPSK');

% Calculate the BLER: Finally, calculate the BLER by comparing the transmitted data to the demodulated data and counting the number of errors. This can be done using a loop or by using the biterr function, which calculates the number of bit errors between two binary sequences. For example:
BLER = biterr(data, demodulated_data) / length(data);
